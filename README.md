# bottlesofbeer

##Description

Rough beer counting application based off of the "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall", created for my Epicodus class. Sources used included Javascript and Jquery, made in Atom text editor.

##Build Process

* Git clone repo
* Drag html file into browser
* Start Game


##Resources

JavaScript
JQuery
HTML
CSS
Atom text editor

##Known Bugs
This application could use some work. I used alerts to return the counter once data has been put in. I did this because anyone who thinks this is still a fun game to play should be punished by clicking the alert prompts as many times as they deem it necessary to repeat every verse of that dreaded song. You deserve it.
